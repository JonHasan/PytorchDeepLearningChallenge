This is the final project for the pytorch deep learning challenge. 

In this notebook, a convolutional neural network is designed using transfer learning to identify flowers from an image dataset. 

The neural network used was resnet 152 that was pretrained and had the last classifier layer remade so that the ouptut was the number of flower classes.
