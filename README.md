# PytorchDeepLearningChallenge
Pytorch scholarship Program. This file repository includes code for the image Classifier Final project. I trained a resnet152 for 3o + 15 epochs using an adam optimizer. I unfroze the third and fourth layer as well as the avgpool and classifier layers first. I then unfroze the entire network for second round of training.
